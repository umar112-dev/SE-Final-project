The Autonomous Drone System for Real-Time Disaster Response (ADSRR) is an intelligent, decentralized platform designed to manage and deploy a fleet of drones in disaster-stricken areas. The system aims to provide real-time situational awareness, assess damage, detect survivors, and relay critical data to emergency response teams.
